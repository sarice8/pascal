
SSL 1.3.0    Aug 23 '93

This is an enhanced version of the SSL language, introducing
variables, expressions, functions with multiple parameters...

It is built using SSL 1.2.8 and ssl_rt 1.1.
It is also implemented using a "schema" database for the
symbol table.

However, client programs must use ssl_rt 2.0
which implements the runtime model produced by this compiler.
