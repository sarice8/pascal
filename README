
SSL 1.2.8        Aug 23 '93

This is a version of the SSL compiler that generates output
compatible with the generic runtime module ssl_rt 1.1.

[ So, client programs may integrate with ssl_rt. ]

In addition, this compiler is itself built using ssl_rt 1.1.
So, it must be compiled by itself.

The language permitted is the same as the original SSL, but some of the
generated variable names are different (e.g. ssl_* instead of w_*)
