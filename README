
SSL 1.2.7

This is the original SSL compiler.  It is built by its own
verison of SSL.  (hssl is the first version hardcoded in C).

The output produced is not compatible with any version of
the generic ssl_rt runtime module.  Client programs must
provide their own table walkers and scanners.
