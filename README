
SSL 1.3.2     Sept 14 '93

Split into two passes: (1) collect definitions including rule parameters
                       (2) generate code for rules

This was done to avoid requiring forward definitions of all rules that
have out/inout parameters (which was becoming a pain).

It is built using the SSL 1.3.1 compiler, though it can compile itself.

It is built using ssl_rt 2.0.  Client programs should
also use ssl_rt 2.0.
