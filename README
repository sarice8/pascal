Schema  1.3    Aug 24 '93

This is the Schema compiler, built using SSL 1.2.8 and the
generic SSL runtime module (ssl_rt 1.1).

It also includes a schema, so it should compile itself.
[ schema 1.2 can be used to compile this, but the
  schema runtime module node.o should be taken from 1.3 ]

The language accepted is the same as the previous schema compilers
and the output is also the same.

The runtime module node.c is compatible with clients
compiled using SSL 1.2.8 or higher.
