Notes from Steve 9/13/2021, while assembling my collection of old projects.

SSL is the Syntax/Semantic Language, invented by my Queen's University professor James Cordy.
An ssl file describes the legal structure of an input stream, and a high level indication of
how to process it.  It was typically used to implement individual passes in a compiler.

This is my own implementation of the language, for my personal compiler projects.

Earlier versions of this tool were used to bootstrap this version.
See git log for those earlier versions, along with tags marking the versions.
