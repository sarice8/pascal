% nMethod is a proc or func declaration.
% qValue is the method address, unless we've only seen a forward declaration
% in which case qAddrDefined is false.
%
% If there's a forward declaration and the body is subsequently seen,
% we'll update the existing nMethod to contain the final information:
% storing the address in qValue, and updating the qParams (since the names
% might differ), and setting qAddrDefined to true.
