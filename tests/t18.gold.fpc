# I consider fpc to be wrong here, so not trying to match it.
# The first "Subtraction: 18" appears to have treated the pointers in
#    @c1[10] - @c1[1]    as universal pointers, rather than typed pointers.


TEST: Starting test
10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 
Subtraction: 18
Subtraction: 9
Pointer comparison worked as expected
Second pointer comparison worked as expected
TEST: Finished test
